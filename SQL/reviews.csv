3,23,4,"The tastiest mutton biryani we ever had. Must visit place for biryani if you are in old city. Startes were okay. We try chicken tikka n chicken leg . They don't have parking space, better to park your vehicle somewhere nearby and walk to this place.",2023-08-12 20:59:31,,1,Shadab Restaurant,https://onlinehyderabad.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hotel-Shadab-1024x484.jpg
4,24,3,"Shadab Restaurant in Hyderabad is a popular dining spot, highly regarded for its signature dish, the ""Hyderabadi Dum Biryani."" With recommendations from local auto drivers and shopkeepers, it's clear that the biryani lives up to its fame. The tender mutton, infused with aromatic spices, creates a heavenly flavor that biryani enthusiasts will thoroughly enjoy. The combination of ""Rumali Roti"" and ""Chicken 65"" further adds to the dining experience, showcasing the restaurant's diverse culinary offerings.

However, while the food at Shadab is exceptional, the overall dining experience can be hindered by some drawbacks. The restaurant's location in a busy area with limited parking can make it a challenge to find a spot. Additionally, the high demand for their famous biryani leads to a crowded and bustling atmosphere, resulting in waiting times for both seating and service. Despite these inconveniences, for those seeking an authentic ""Hyderabadi Dum Biryani,"" Shadab Restaurant remains a must-visit for its exceptional biryani alone.",2023-07-28 17:23:49,,0,Shadab Restaurant,https://onlinehyderabad.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hotel-Shadab-1024x484.jpg

7,27,4,It is decent. Biryani is the famous dish here; it will be much loved by flavour lovers but not as much by spicy food lovers. The meat is good. Definitely worth a try,2023-08-17 16:11:13,,1,Shadab Restaurant,https://onlinehyderabad.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hotel-Shadab-1024x484.jpg
8,28,1,Compared with chicken biryani mutton biryani is worse. Taking too much charge for that and serving only bones of mutton.

Then i approach to cashier n ask about incharge, he replied I'm the incharge..
I explained to him aforesaid matter.
He replied you would have inform us before having the Biryani, I asked him who is owner he replied he is out of country.

Waiter kept saying it's going to take 1 hour and do u want to wait ? We literally had to stand and the waiters treat u like thrash ! Extremely terrible crowd management !  The food in Shadab maybe legendary, but if u give such thrashy service, one day you gonna fall down ! After a wait of 15 mins, we finally got a table. Food was good and met our expectations but the service experience ruined our mood and we just wanted to get out of that place !
